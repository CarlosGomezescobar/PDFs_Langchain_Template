Langchain OpenAI embedding
 It's an example of text classification using deep learning and natural language processing techniques.

The project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on the review text. The dataset used is the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.

The notebook uses the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to classify the reviews. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequential data processing, making them ideal for natural language processing tasks such as text classification.

The notebook also uses pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to represent each word in the movie review as a vector. GloVe is a global word embedding technique that summarizes the global context of each word in a vector space. This allows the LSTM model to better understand the meaning of each word and its relationship to other words in the sentence.

The notebook goes through several steps of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. It achieves an accuracy of around 80% in classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.

Overall, this project is a great example of how deep learning and natural language processing can be used for text classification tasks.
